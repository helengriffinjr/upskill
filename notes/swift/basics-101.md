``` swift
let age = 16
print(age)
```

- **view**: any visual element that conforms to View protocol
- **instance**: type value
``` swift
let motion = MotionSensor()
//motion is an instance of MotionSensor
```
- **initialize, initialization**: creates an instance of type aka set initial values, properties
- **struct** is similar to a class
- don't need to use variable `var` instead initialize view instances `Text("Hello world")` since you don't modify view instances anywhere else but the line that created it
